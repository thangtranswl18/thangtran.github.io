      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Habita (the “App”) is a habit tracking application developed by Thang Tran (“we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information when you use it. We aim to collect the minimum data necessary to provide core features such as tracking habits, showing ads (which you can remove via in‑app purchase), and sending local notifications.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data We Process</h2>
        <p>We designed Habita so that your habit data is stored locally on your device. We do not operate our own servers to store your personal data.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local app data</strong> (on device): habits, tracking progress, settings, and preferences. Stored using local database and shared preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>In‑app purchases</strong>: purchase state (e.g., “ads removed”) may be stored locally to unlock features. Purchase transactions are processed by Google Play (or Apple on iOS) and subject to their policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: the App schedules local notifications on your device. If you grant notification permission, the system delivers reminders; we do not receive the content of notifications on our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional file access</strong>: if you import/export data, the App may temporarily access files you select via the system file picker. Access is limited to the files you choose.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising identifiers and device information</strong> (via third‑party SDKs): when ads are shown, our advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob) may collect device information and identifiers in accordance with their policies.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates third‑party services which may collect and process data independently:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</strong> – used to display ads. AdMob may collect device information, IP address, approximate location inferred from IP, advertising identifiers (e.g., AAID), and performance metrics. Learn more: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Privacy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob Policy</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> – used for in‑app purchases. Google processes payment information; we do not receive your full payment details. See <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2850369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Payments Privacy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your interaction with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies in addition to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide core functionality (habit tracking, reminders, settings).</li>
          <li>Show ads and measure performance (when ads are enabled).</li>
          <li>Process purchases and unlock features (e.g., remove ads).</li>
          <li>Improve stability and user experience.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We only share data with service providers as needed to operate the App (e.g., AdMob for advertising, Google Play for billing), subject to their policies and applicable laws.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your habit data resides on your device and remains there until you delete the App or clear the App’s data. Purchase receipts may be retained by platform providers per their retention requirements. Advertising partners may retain data according to their policies.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ads</strong>: You can remove ads via a one‑time in‑app purchase. You can also adjust ad personalization in your device settings or within your Google account.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: You can enable/disable notifications in the App or in your device settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Data export</strong>: You may export/import data using the system file picker (when available).</li>
          <li><strong>Uninstall</strong>: You may uninstall the App at any time to delete locally stored data.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the App. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>International Users</h2>
        <p>If you use the App from outside your country, you consent to the processing of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable local laws.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
